Vendora is a sample e-commerce company that sells popular electronics globally. In this portfolio project, I analyzed a smaple dataset to investigate trends and growth rates in revenue, average order value (AOV), product analysis, marketing channels, and refund rates to surface insights on overall company performance. I also investigated the effectiveness of their recently launched loyalty program to give recommendations on the continuation of the program.
